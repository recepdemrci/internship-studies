CoW(Copy-on-write)
------------------------

Copy-on-write or CoW is a technique to efficiently copy data resources in a computer system. 
If a unit of data is copied but not modified, the "copy" can exist as a reference to the original data. 
Only when the copied data is modified is a copy created, and new bytes are actually written.

Copy-on-write (sometimes referred to as "COW") is an optimization strategy used in computer programming.
The fundamental idea is that if multiple callers ask for resources which are initially indistinguishable, 
you can give them pointers to the same resource. This function can be maintained until a caller tries to modify
its "copy" of the resource, at which point a true private copy is created to prevent the changes becoming visible to everyone else.
All of this happens transparently to the callers. The primary advantage is that if a caller never makes any modifications,
no private copy need ever be created.
